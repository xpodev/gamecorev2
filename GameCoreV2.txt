GameCoreV1 (AKA GameCore) is a game-system developed in unity that provides ModSupport and Logging

(?) means that the item might not be included in the final product
ND = "Not Defined" which means the API is not yet defined
DONE = The feature is done
WIP = The feature is currently in progress
TODO = The feature needs more features

We need to rewrite MdpLib.

GameCoreV2 for Unity is supposed to be a better version that brings more features:
1) Game modding (with Mdp auto update & auto install) using ModuleManager	[DONE, WIP]
2) System Management (with many built-in systems) 				[DONE, WIP]
3) Logging (included in System Management)					[WIP, TODO]
4) Object Database								[DONE, WIP]
5) Multiplayer interface (maybe some another library that supports that)	[WIP]
6) Provides some basic interfaces for common object types
7) World generation
8) Extendable core (?)
9) Unity editor integration (with custom editor builder(?))
10) Adds Unity objects serialization (binary, semi binary, json)
11) Adds Mdp support (Mdp is a library used for updating purposes)		[DONE, TODO]
12) Supports custom calendars & scheduled events
13) Game launcher (?)
14) Configurable modules (?)
15) ConfigParser
16) Controls config file reader
17) Many MonoBehaviour classes to get you started quickly
18) Mdp server manager (with Unity editor integration (?))
19) Customizable xml based configurators					[DONE, WIP]
20) building systems (grid, free, free_snap)
21) In-game scripting (python)							[DONE]
22) Game console (for commands. eg. for minecraft: /time set 0)
23) Localization (that works perfectly with the Database)

About NodeEditor: it already exists. search for "Unity visual scripting" (Bolt, which  isn't very good)

GameCoreV2 is very well documented

Currently, the only way to load prefabs is using AssetBundles.
